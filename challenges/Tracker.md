Challenge: **Tracker**

Description: **WebSec team has recently partnered with Interpol to track some blackhat hackers that hacked the DNC. Turns out one of them is in Nepal. So we decided to track his daily movement. What college does this hacker go to? Format: _[college name]_ spaces allowed/required.**

The file for this challenge is [here](trackerchallengefile). 

Once you download the file, you can find that the extension of this file is GPX. Through online site like [this](http://maplorer.com/gpx-view/gpx_view.php), you can import that GPX and view all the coordinates on the mapped object. 

Coordinates in this GPX represented everyday life events of the supposed target. Out of all the locations, we only had one coordinate for an unversity: **Trinity International College**

So now putting **[Trinity International College]** gives us the points. 

Points:**50**
