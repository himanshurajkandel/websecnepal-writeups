Challenge: **Hack me if you can**

Description: **168.235.91.31 good luck.**

When you first try to go to I.P. it says Request Denied. So we know that port 80 and 443 are closed. When we decide to run a port scan, we find that certain ports are open for example port 21 and 22. 

When we go to port 21 through `ftp://168.235.91.31/`, we see a folder called _OMG_. When we open the folder there is a file called flag.txt which has the flag: **flag{ch4ll3ng3_ftp_an0n}**
