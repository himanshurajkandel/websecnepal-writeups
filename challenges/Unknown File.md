Challenge: **Unknown File**

Link for the file: **https://mega.nz/#!wugiFbhQ!Q1bu9v1xnNiRcRwXURs7eTxpOACp_wC-cm-sfK3kuis**

A file with no extension is provided. After downloading the file, you will have to use HEX Editor to identify file type. Once that is done, you will get a .wav file containing a song. WAV files are commonly used in CTF for Steg challenges. 

So going to an online link like [this](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html), would allow us to get the flag: **flag{90238_12903_w4v_steg_fun}**
