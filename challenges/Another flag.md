When you open the file after downloading, it is a JPEG Picture of Nepal's Flag. There is nothing much you can find until you run a scan to see if it has hidden files. 

This JPEG file had a zip file hidden with it. This zip file was password protected which could easily be bruteforced by using any words related to websecnepal competition.

Once you unzip the file, there is a txt file which has the flag: **flag{Z1P_INSIDE_IMAGE?_SAD}**

Points:**50**
