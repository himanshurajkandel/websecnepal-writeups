Challenge: **One Time Prank**

Description: **Someone pranked me once and did not tell me the key for this cipher bpby{sOT_C0J_DTD_IT}, I wonder what the key is?**

Description says that there is a need to find the key for the flag. The title says `One Time Prank` could this be related with OTP Cipher or One Time Pad?

We can bruteforce the key by guessing words closely related with the CTF. A guess of `websecnepal` works perfectly as the key. We get the flag: **flag{oMG_Y0U_DID_IT}**

Points:**150**
